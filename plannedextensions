I'll probably never add these, but to put in writing:
new functionality:
$ dereferences, & is address-of
 imports
  malloc(bytes: integer) : u64,
  printf(format: u8arr, ...) : integer

new tokens:
import, &, $, u64, ...
  u8 on a later version?
TIMPT, TAMPS, TDOLL, TUINT
new symbol type:
SU64
new nodes:
NIMPRT, NADR, NDOLL, NELPSS (elipsis)

other extensions:
removing main as a requirement, to make importable functions
name mangling file-local variables
preprocessor that converts '\n' etc. to int literals
possibly general preprocessor for macros
u64 type for pointers, for C compatiblity
u8 type for strings
typed TAC for ABI compatibility for float function args
